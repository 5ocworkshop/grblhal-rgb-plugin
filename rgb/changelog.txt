  Changelog:

  Version 1.0   First official release
                Added licensing information
                Moved to rgb directory as a named plugin
                Requested including in grblHAL plugin_init.h
                Updated readme.txt
                Moved this information to changelog.txt
                Moved pending items and ideas to todo.txt
                NEW: Made idle light colour a configurable variable in the code, will move to $ setting in future
                NEW: Tested against new serial-api with and IR remote control plugin (separate plugin)
                NEW: Inspection light cycles to red or red/magenta if cutter is on
                NEW: Locally connect Auxin to button that can toggle inspection light
                FIXED: Reset button in UI causes all lights to go off
                Note: Port assignment in the init function needs a rework, works for grblHAL2000 but is not properly dynamic yet

--- Historical entries in chronological order ---

  Version .1    Imported from JAC project from grbl-Mega and adjusted for basic STATE lights

  Version .2    Added checks for spindle on and override with RED to indicate warning
                Moved alarm and spindle checks from report function to realtime new loop function
                Simplified switch statement for static state light indicators
                Moved RGB color table to a struct/array, simplifying rgb_set_state() to 3 lines
                First check-in to personal git repo
                Fixed bug in handling state_get() that was causing lights to indicate idle after alarm trigger

  Version .3    Add discrete light sequences for particular alarms
                Added configuration array so lights can be easily mapped to current & new alarm codes
                Added three different delay variables to configs to improve communication
                Standarized on three slow red flashses to indicate ALARM
                    Followed by (with no RGB_OFF in between these levels):
                        ALARM INFORM                e.g. Yellow for homing event 
                        ALARM DETAIL (If Exists)    e.g. Green for seek
                        ALARM HINT (If Exists)      e.g. Red for X axis
                Added STATE_HOLD flashing yellow
                Added OnProgramCompleted (M2/M30), Chequered Flag flash sequence

  Version .4  Added Inspection Light, turned on via MCode `M356 Q1` and off via `M356 Q2`
                    This may require additional trigger option, if can't send mcode during cycle run
                Added Flood || Mist indicator (Magenta) during spindle on condition
                Added extensive comments throughout code
                Corrected small bug in Alarm loop that was causing some alarms to have 2 instead of 3 RED flashes at start
 
  Version .5    Extended handling of Inspection Light cases
                    -If Spindle is also on, 0.5s White (ACK), 0.5s Red (Caution) then loop 5s white light, followed by 0.5s red
                    -If Flood or Mist are also on, they flash for .5s after Red in both situations

  Version .6    Added rgb_delay_ms() non-blocking delay function for lights
                Re-factored entire alarm module to use rgb_delay_ms, making the code easier to read and use

  Version .7    August 10, 2021
                Fixed bugs in otherlights function
                Removed various pieces of unused code
                Cleaned up many of the comments
