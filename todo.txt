  To Do List

In no particular order, ideas for new features and issues that require investigation or resolution

 To Do:        !IMPORTANT! - Address situation where after chequred flag RED for spindle is NOT restored (or is this a Makita issue?)
                Clean up and optimize code
                Within ALARM function
                    -Pulse axis color (R/G/B for X/Y/Z) within limit alarm cycle (likewise A/B/C axis)
                    -Differentiate between fast homing and seek in homing sequence
                Add light sequence for tool length setting steps
                Document and annotate code - ongoing
                Add optional ? status report section showing which lights are triggered for troubleshooting/setup?
                Move in to formal plug-in structure and do public commit - DONE
                Add flash state for door open condition - Investigate why this isn't an Alarm?
                Add appropriate comment pre-amble and disclaimer
                Add ability to set timings from $ settings? - DEFER
                Have version number from #define update in report
                Support a terse a verbose alarm level.  Terse being only Inform level, Verbose being Detail & Hint
                Resolve initial delay triggering RGB_RED on STATE_ALARM
                Determine if blocking during M30 Program Completed is an issue and if so find non-blocking method
                Noticed Hold came up as Hold:0, investigate
                Re-strcutre RGB state machine to consolidate functions and improve readability
                What is the deal with logging?  Can we do rsyslog somehow?
                Investigate why resetting from STATE_IDLE does not result in lights recovering
                Investigate transition from STATE_HOLD to STATE_ALARM (got green lighht unexpectedly)
                Investigate why turning on the ILIGHT when the Spindle is already on, doesn't trigger the restart/inform sequence
                Investigate apparent situation where completion of successful gcode & chequered flag may result in lights being off completely (poss resolved)
                Add option to toggle idle state light from blue to inspection light per @Drewnabobber suggestion (done in code, TBD in $settings)
                Expose options for idle light color and which pins are R/G/B via $ settings
                Port assignment in the init function needs a rework, works for grblHAL2000 but is not properly dynamic yet
                Add debug logging routine to UART port for future debugging
